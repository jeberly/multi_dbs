= Multi-Database plugin for rails

by John Eberly

Use this plugin to have access to multiple databases in rails.  I have not used this in a production environment yet.  If you use this plugin, please drop me a note letting me know of your impressions, problems, etc.

= Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/jeberly/multi_dbs.git

= Example Use

Here is a real life usage of the plugin for specifying a separate database for each model.

= Set database name for any model that does not use default specified in database.yml file

class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  set_database_name "db2"
  belongs_to :blog
end

The table blog must exist in your default database and table posts should exist in database "db2"

Now you can do this -> # Blog.first.posts
